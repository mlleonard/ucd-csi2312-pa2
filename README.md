 This program takes in input for a multi-dimensional point (the point can be as many dimensions as the user defines).
 These points are the members (instances of) the Point class. There are then many functions within the point class which modify, add, delete, and 
 compare the points to one another ( many of these features will later come into play within the Cluster class). The program then adds these points 
 to a linked list of Cluster class which holds a variety of points (eventually based on their proximity to one another). The Cluster class also 
 has many functions which attempt to modify, add, delete, and compare both the Clusters to one another as well as at times points to the clusters.
